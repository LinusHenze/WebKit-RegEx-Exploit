    <div class="block block-strong">
      <p>When you think 3rd Party AppStore, you probably think of shady services like Tutu Helper, Panda Helper or Top Store who have previously been involved in shady business tatics and data mining.</p>
      <p>These services are everything Ignition strives not to be. We put the user first and aim to hit the highest possible mark of user satisfaction.</p>
      <p>Though 3rd Party AppStores have been around for a very long time, none have taken the amount of time and dedication that we have to ensure users have an amazing experience while using our platform.</p>

    <div class="block-title">History of Ignition</div>
    <div class="block block-strong">
      <p>Ignition started back in October 2017 as a crowd-funded 3rd Party AppStore that was completely ad-free and it received quite a bit of recognition for this.</p>
      <p>However about a month or so later the crowd-funding stopped and therefore ended the life of Ignition.</p>
      <p>Until July 2018, Ignition was dead. A developer and future-business partner contacted us in hopes of reviving Ignition, and provided the first two signing certificates. Two weeks later Ignition was alive again and ready for use by the public, later to be formed into what we are today.</p>
