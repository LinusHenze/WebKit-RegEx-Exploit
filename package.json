  "description": "This is currently only patched in the WebKit sources (just to clarify this: Yes, it still works on iOS 12.1.1, meaning every iOS version since 12.0 is vulnerable. There is currently no iOS 12.x version that is not vulnerable. Every macOS version since 10.14.0 is vulnerable as well.) and works with the latest version of Safari (macOS and iOS, although this needs to be updated in order to work with iOS).   Please don't do evil stuff with this.   And if you're a normal user, this will be useless for you.",
